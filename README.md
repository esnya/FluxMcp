ProtoFlux MCP Server Mod
========================

This project provides a simple MonkeyLoader mod implementing a prototype MCP server.
It exposes placeholders for controlling ProtoFlux nodes in Resonite. Current features
include basic TCP handling and an in-memory node store. Full interaction with
Resonite will require further implementation.
